# 📈 Agency - Digital Marketing Agency Website Clone

## 📝 Description
**Agency** is a frontend project that I created based on a design I found online. For my learning experience, I recreated it from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project showcases the services offered by a digital marketing agency, providing information about the agency’s approach, team, and portfolio. The goal of this project was to demonstrate frontend development skills and to practice modern web design techniques.

Developed for learning purposes, **Agency** uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a clean, professional, and responsive digital marketing agency website.
